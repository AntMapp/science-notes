# Governance In DeFi

Decentralized finance (DeFi) has emerged as a potential substitute for traditional financial institutions, offering peer-to-peer transactions and a diverse range of services that democratize finance by enabling users to participate in protocol governance. However, several studies have suggested that the current governance mechanisms require improvements. This article provides an overview of findings associated with DeFi governance.

## Centralised Governance in DeFi Protocols

 Several studies have identified a significant level of centrality in the governance mechanisms of DeFi protocol. Barbereau et al., {cite}`barbereau2022defi` found that the decentrality of voting in DeFi is significantly low with a majority of the voting power concentrated among a percentage of governance token holders. As evidenced by their findings, there was a significant degree of centrality, in lending protocols, decentralisd exchanges and yield aggregators. This study used case studies to comprehend the governance mechanisms of these protocols.

Similarly, Jensen et al. {cite}`jensen2021decentralized` results demonstrate centrality in voting power with the protcols top 5, top 100, and top 1000 wallet addresses controlling majority of the voting power in Balancer, Compound, Uniswap and Yearn Finance protocols. In this study, the token holdings and users' wallets of protocols were analysed; Compound displayed the most evidence of centrality and Uniswap the least with the top 5 wallet addresses accounting for 42.1% and 12.05%, respectively.

Barbereau et al. {cite}`barbereau2022decentralised` ascertained that DeFi protocols become more centralized over time. In this longitudinal study, voting patterns demonstrated changes in the voting power dynamics over time. Furthermore, in analysing the governance structures of DeFi protocols, Stroponiati et al. {cite}`stroponiati5decentralized` ascribed reward-based economic incentives as the significant cause behind the development of centralized structures.
 
## Challenges & Vulnerability In DeFi Governance

In investigating governance challenges, Ekal et al., {cite}`ekal2022defi` identified voter collusion, low participation rates, and voter apathy as the most significant challenges. This empirical investigation utilised an interview survey approach to collect data from protocol users. Furthermore, to address vulnerabilities, Mohan et al. {cite}`mohan2022voting` proposed a novel voting mechanism resistant to sybil attacks called bond voting. This solution factors in time commitment to be resistant to plutocracy. 

## AI-enabled On-chain Governance

To enhance and automate governance mechanisms, Xu et al., {cite}`xu2023auto` demonstrated an AI-enabled parameter adjustment solution which is more efficent than current current implementations. Specifically, the study employed Deep Q-network (DQN) reinforcement learning to investigate for automated parameter selection in a DeFi environment. Although a lending protocol was employed in the study, the model's application can extend to other categories of DeFi protocols as well.

## Conclusion
To conclude, this paper has provided an overview of existing research studies on the governance of DeFi. Continuous research and development in DeFi governance is necessary to ensure its long-term sustainability and success.
