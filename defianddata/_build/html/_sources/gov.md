# Governance In DeFi

Decentralised finance (DeFi) has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional financial institutions by offering peer-to-peer transactions and a variety of services. DeFi enables users to participate in governance of protocols, thereby democratizing finance. However, several studies have explored improvements to current governance mechanisms. This article provides an overview of findings in DeFi governance.

## Evolution of Governance in DeFi Protocols
 Barbereau et al., {cite}`barbereau2022decentralised` conducted a longitudinal study on the voting pattern of protocols, factoring in the change in voting power. They concluded that DeFi protocols demonstrated an increase in centralization over time. The evolution of governance in several DeFi protocols follows a pattern with three major stages: centralized team-based governance, decentralized token-based governance, and centralized token-based governance {cite}`stroponiati5decentralized`. Initially, the team adopts a centralized governance framework to facilitate key decision-making processes. However, there is a gradual shift from team to token-based governance through the allocation of tokens to protocol users to foster decentralization in the ecosystem.


## Centralised Governance in DeFi Protocols

 Several studies have investigated the degree of decentralization in DeFi protocols with various methodologies utilized. Barbereau et al., {cite}`barbereau2022defi` analyzed lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, and yield aggregators by conducting case studies to understand the governance mechanisms. All three types of protocols demonstrated a significant degree of centrality. In an empirical analysis of the top DeFi protocols, Jensen et al., {cite}`jensen2021decentralized` examined the wallet addresses and token holdings of users and found evidence of centrality, with voting power controlled by the top 5, top 100, and top 1000 addresses. The protocols analyzed in this study included Compound, Uniswap, Compound, Balancer, and Yearn Finance. In this study, Compound showed the highest evidence of centrality, and Uniswap the least, with the top 5 address for both constituting 42.1% and 12.05% respectively. Ekal et al., {cite}`ekal2022defi` identified challenges such as voter collusion, low participation, and voter apathy in decentralized governance through a survey of users of DeFi protocols conducted via interviews.

## Vunerability of Centralised DeFi Governance 

Stroponiati et al., {cite}`stroponiati5decentralized` identified security vunerabilities associated with centralised DeFi Governance. Utilizing an approval voting mechanism through an "executive contract," MakerDAO's smart contract enables modifications to the overall system state. Nevertheless, this approach renders MakerDAO's governance framework susceptible to exploitative contracts, which can potentially gain control of the contract and siphon off up to $2 billion worth of collateralized funds.

## Challenges Identified in Decentralised Governance
Ekal et al., {cite}`ekal2022defi` conducted an empirical investigation of challenges within decentralized governance, utilizing an interview survey approach to collect data from protocol users. The study identified voter collusion, low participation rates, and voter apathy as the most significant challenges confronting decentralized governance.

## AI-enabled On-chain Governance

Xu et al., {cite}`xu2023auto` utilized reinforcement learning to investigate automated parameter selection in a DeFi environment. Deep Q-network (DQN) reinforcement learning was used to propose semi-automated adjustment of parameters. Evaluation of results demonstrated that this AI-enabled approach is more efficient than current implementations. Although a lending protocol was employed in the study, the model's application can extend to other categories of protocols as well.

## Conclusion
To conclude, this paper has provided an overview of existing research studies on the governance of DeFi Continuous research and development in DeFi governance is necessary to ensure its long-term sustainability and success.
