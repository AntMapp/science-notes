# **DSF Blog Guide**

This document serves as a guide for current and future writers who wish to contribute to our blog. We value high-quality technical content focused on blockchain technology and want to ensure that all blog posts adhere to a consistent writing structure. The blog series will be divided into three major categories, namely:

1. **Academic Insights**: This category will feature blog posts that highlight academic research findings related to blockchain technology, cryptography, distributed ledger technology (DLT), and other relevant topics. Blogs in this category with include a comprehensive overview of recent research papers in a subject-area. and will be findings-focused.
2. **Industry Perspectives**: This category will include blog posts that provide findings and insights focused on the industry applications of blockchain-related subject matters.
3. **Innovation & Ideation**: This category will focus on highlighting innovative ideas, concepts, and use cases related to blockchain technology. It will feature blog posts that explore potential applications of blockchain in various industries, such as finance, supply chain, healthcare, and more.

Guidelines for blogs articles published emphasizing structure, formatting, representations on diagrams and more are as follows:

## Tone

Our blog has an informative and objective tone. We want to be clear and concise and focus on presenting information and data in an unbiased manner. We want writers to use a professional tone that demonstrates a strong understanding of the subject matter and an ability to present complex information in a way that is easy to understand for a technical audience.

## Structure

All blog posts should have a clear structure that is easy to follow. The structure of the blog should be as followed:

**Title → Key Insights → Introduction → Sub-topics → Diagram → Conclusion**

## Formatting

Use title headings in H1 and subheadings in H2 to break up your content into sections. Margins should also be employed to provide information on technical terms. An example of this is given in this [article](https://github.com/xujiahuayz/dsfblog/blob/main/blogs/gov.md).


## Diagrams

Screenshots of diagrams or figures in papers should not be used. Diagrams should be drawn using technical software such as [draw.io](http://draw.io). Furthermore, diagrams should not stretch beyond 750px. 

## Feedback

Feedback on blogs will be provided by other researchers. Install “TODOs extension’ in VSCode to highlight feedback.

## References

**References should be only from academic journals.** The reference format for in-text citations and bibliographies is given here.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure there is a cohesive style and structure between blogs. Happy writing!
