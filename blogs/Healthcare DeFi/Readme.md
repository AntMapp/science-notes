# Healthcare on the blockchain

> *"Health is the greatest of human blessings." – Hippocrates.*

One can ‘successfully’ argue that healthcare is a fundamental resource continuously impacting the trajectory of human civilisation. It is a heavy-handed influence reflected in the worldwide GDP; in the UK alone it accounted for 12.4% GDP in 2021.

Consequently, a logical line of questioning would be: what direction is civilisation headed towards when faced with a healthcare landscape littered with multifaceted challenges? Challenges ranging from:

- Access to Healthcare
    - Healthcare Quality and Patient Safety
    - Health Inequities
    - Rising Healthcare Costs
    - Healthcare supply-chain
    - Healthcare Workforce Shortages
- Healthcare silos
    - Healthcare Policy and Regulation
    - Healthcare Data Security
    - Ethical Dilemmas
- Environmental Health
- and more…

Healthcare and innovation are inextricably linked and, when properly implemented, serve as a robust measure of a successful nation. On a global scale, we are witnessing a decline in that metric due to healthcare frameworks inundated with incapacities in sustainably addressing these challenges. Adopting a DeFi approach to healthcare eco-systems is one of the few innovations proposing potential solutions. 

## DeFi?

DeFi is a portmanteau for Decentralised Finance. It is a trustless user-centred framework leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts and security protocols to facilitate direct peer-to-peer exchanges. 

As of 2021, the global DeFi market size was estimated at approximately $11.64 Billion USD. Additionally, it holds a 2030 forecast growth of more than 1500%; appetising stats for investors. Hence, we can hypothesise, with some confidence, that healthcare eco-systems will follow the trend and open to new opportunities as seen in other industries already operating in the DeFi space.

Here are a few definitions to help engage with the content in this review:

- **Blockchain:**
    - Blockchain is a disruptive technology; it is an immutable distributed digital ledger that relies on cryptographic protocols to securely maintain transaction records across a network. Integrity of data naturally emerges from its framework; consequently central authorities and intermediaries are no longer required.
- **Trustless:**
    - Trustless refers to the integrity and transparency innate to blockchain technologies; an environment where centralised authority/intermediary is no longer required to guarantee trust.
- **Smart Contracts:**
    - Smart contracts usher in a new generation of automation; these are digital contracts constructed from self-executing algorithms that enforce terms and execute actions when specific criteria are met. All this without the need for any central authority.

## Data security

Current measures to modernise the healthcare industry hinge upon EHRs (electronic health records). Ideally, EHRs operate as the foundation for health informatics; underpinning effective data flow of a patient’s medical history/profile along with clinical and administrative data. 

Unfortunately, the full potential of EHRs has not been realised due to a number of caveats. One of the main hinderances is the disparate policies & regulations across many hospitals and other healthcare & insurance institutions. A lack of standardised structured-data formats, inhibitions to sharing information and risk of data-leaks give rise to hefty healthcare silos that harbour these information asymmetries. Ambiguous monopolies thrive in this fragmented framework; hence, retrieval and logging of health data becomes tedious, costly and prone to error.

### Interoperability

The immutable and decentralised nature specific to DeFi models allows for an infrastructure that improves coordination and dissolves data silos while preserving privacy. Interoperability can be considered as efficient communication between several heterogeneous applications and/or systems. In the case of EHRs, this definition requires effective communication without breaching the data integrity & security of the EHR content exchanged.

92377 classes interoperability into three subdivisions:

- Semantic
    - the tools and models underpinning the interoperable platforms
- Syntactic
    - Interoperable functions shared across platforms with compatible interfaces
- Organisational
    - collaborative incentives for information exchange across political, legal and social entities.

## Healthcare Supply Chain

DeFi frameworks offer a host of features that aptly complement supply chain analytics across supply chain management industries. The pharmaceutical supply chain is not exempt and can benefit from the authentication, traceability & transparency aspects innate to DeFi. 

The immutable ledgers ensure data integrity and regulatory compliance while simultaneously providing real-time inventory management. This all supports reliable authentication and smart contracts which lead to cost reductions; improved user-trust & patient-safety due to reduced fraudulent/counterfeit pharmaceuticals and healthcare products.

## Caveats.

Though hailing as a disruptive technology; DeFi does not come without its shortcomings. Scalability is a major frontrunner facing critical issues. 

- With the advent of IoT devices, real-time monitoring of patients already inundates healthcare EHRs; these can further exacerbate latency issues on the blockchain.
- Widespread implementation faces social and economic pushback; legacy thinking within healthcare ecosystems are change averse and this compounds with initial costs for integrating DeFi infrastructure.

## Conclusion

The DeFi market is a fertile market space for innovation, not solely-constrained to financial industries. The prospects of patient-centred and patient-driven healthcare opens up a host of tangible prospects; some seemingly fetched from science fiction novels. Hence, DeFi healthcare  galvanises research opportunities into new technologies such as digital twinning simulations, secure distributed AI and emergent phenomena. 

With more autonomy and self-governance, what destination(s) can you envision for human civilisation?
